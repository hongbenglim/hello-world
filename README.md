# hello-world
Hi there people! 

My name is Ben. The two things I love are math and teaching.

Years in the future, but not many, I might become a professor. But who knows? I'm still a student for now. 

I study statistics, so there's a fair bit of computing and coding going on as well. The coding language I'm most familiar with is R. I use this place to store some of the cooler projects I've worked with.
